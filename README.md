What is it?
=================

Adding a shift schedule to your google calendar contains a lot of unnecessary steps. It is not possible to add the same type of shifts to multiple dates at once. This web app should solve this problem. 

To configure everything you need to do this (you only need to these steps once, your browser will remember it):
* Define your shift types
* Connect to your Google calendar 
 
The workflow of adding your shifts looks like this:
* Select the shift type you want to add.
* Select the calendar you want ot add the shifts to.
* Select the dates.
* Sumbit it.
